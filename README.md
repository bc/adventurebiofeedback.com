# Amplify is a voice-therapist in a box
With our voice-controlled device, the child can explore an interactive audible journey in the format of a choose-your-own-adventure story, replete with exercises and voice interactions that define the trajectory of the narrative; all the while, the system collects detailed analytical voice data on pitch, volume, and pronunciation clarity.
