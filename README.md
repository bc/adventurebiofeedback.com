# We believe that no child should have their sense of expression suppressed
Yet, for more than half of all children affected by Cerebral Palsy (CP: a common lifelong congenital disorder), effective vocal communication is set back by difficulties with speech volume, articulation, word formation, among others. Traditional speech therapy has proven benefits, but visits to the doctor and repetitive exercises make therapy itself a hurdle for many. It is inaccessible to low-income mothers and fathers who cannot afford the travel time or payments. Today’s voice-assistant infrastructure can be leveraged to deliver treatment that matches or exceeds outcomes of traditional speech therapy. This would not be possible without the new social ubiquity of voice assistants in the home, the accessibility of AI voice analysis algorithms, and established therapeutic techniques, such as Lee Silverman Voice Therapy (LSVT Loud). 


# Introducing our product, Amplify:
With our voice-controlled device, the child can explore an interactive audible journey in the format of a choose-your-own-adventure story, replete with exercises and voice interactions that define the trajectory of the narrative; all the while, the system collects detailed analytical voice data on pitch, volume, and pronunciation clarity. Ultimately this system can support programs that are matched to specific clinical manifestations at-home, and can be expanded to incorporate the unique cultures, languages, and customs of different populations. This experience will engage and enthrall a child with CP, create a visual progress dashboard for parents and therapists, and open the child’s ability to express themselves both vocally and socially.
Distance and cost should not determine access to therapy for children with CP.

## What is Cerebral Palsy?

Cerebral Palsy is a congenital movement disorder which can manifest in a wide variety movement and even cognitive symptoms.  It stems from brain damage near the time of birth, often due to a stroke.  Because of this, Patients with cerebral palsy have a wide variety of challenges—one of those is the ability to communicate effectively with their family, peers, and other adults.  This is especially detrimental at an early age. ] 
The problems with communication are common (⅓ - ½ of all affected children), and are addressed by speech therapy with a doctor or within the school system.
